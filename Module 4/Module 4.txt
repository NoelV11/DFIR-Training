Module 4

Evidence Requirements,from the cloud

Access-Cloud service providers have the duty to protect their client's data

Usage Controls

Authentication

Authentication Factors


Documents under Seal-Should meeet the following requirements:-

The public officer placing the seal on document should be trusted
The seal is not forged
and both the signature and seal are affixed by the same public officier

Standards allowing the use of electronic seals and signatures-UETA and E-SIGN

Collection of evidence,from the cloud/cloud based crime

A warrant should be created and kept in hand.It should cover:-
VM's
Data Logs
Nettwork traffic from a particular IP
Access Logs and 
Firewall Logs


Validation of cloud based evidence is carried out by-cryptographic check sums

Forensics Steps in CLoud based evidence
Acquisation,Authentication and Analysis

Challenges faced by evidence collection from cloud:-

Privacy laws affecting servers storing information in different countries

Data stored on the cloud are volatile
Cloud environment can have chance to migrate and is movable

Timestamp and datestamp recorded on files will not be reflective of the actual activity performed on the file

Difference in cloud plattforms.Not able to work with different plattfirns

Mobile Forensics

1'st step-Seize the evidence in protective evidence bags and lablelled.Turned off and battery should be detatched from device

Charge the device-So as to not lose data
Turn off the device
Data should be extracted from the device first,if required by warrant.

The IPhone's interior:-
Cocoa Touch
Media Services
Core Services
Core OS

An investigator should know the limitations of a mobile evidence

Game Consoles:-
Used as illegal gambling machines
Hackers can easily penetrate websites,without getting caught
Vulnerable Systems-XBox 360 and PS3

softmod-Install of software into the console controller
hardmod-Applying hardware

Investigators can team up on game sessions,to chat up suspects,document chats and gain digital evidence

A Linux distro machine can work inside an XBox
An Xbox can be modoified for usage as a web server,personal computer

Very less information or references on hw to extract information from an XBox

In game communication is not stored anywhere.Everything from billing purchases,IP Address of box is stored by Microsoft

Vulnerabilities in XBox-.wav and xtf files -Buffer Overflow
