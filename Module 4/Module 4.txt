Evidence Requirement, from the cloud

Access-Cloud service providers must protect their client's data

Usage Controls

Authentication

Authentication Factors


Documents under Seal-Should meet the following requirements:-

The public officer placing the seal on the document should be trusted

A warrant should be created and kept in hand. It should cover:-
VM's
Data Logs
Network traffic from a particular IP
Access Logs and 
Firewall Logs


Validation of cloud-based evidence is carried out by-cryptographic checksums

Forensics Steps in CLoud based evidence
Acquisition, Authentication, and Analysis

Challenges faced by evidence collection from the cloud:-

Privacy laws affecting servers storing information in different countries

Data stored on the cloud are volatile
Cloud environment can have chance to migrate and is movable

Timestamp and datestamp recorded on files will not be reflective of the actual activity performed on the file

The difference in cloud platforms.Not able to work with different platforms

Mobile Forensics

1'st step-Seize the evidence in protective evidence bags and label it. Turned off and the battery should be detached from the device

Charge the device-So as to not lose data
Turn off the device
Data should be extracted from the device first if required by a warrant.

The iPhone's interior:-
Cocoa Touch
Media Services
Core Services
Core OS

An investigator should know the limitations of a mobile evidence

Game Consoles:-
Used as illegal gambling machines
Hackers can easily penetrate websites, without getting caught
Vulnerable Systems-Xbox 360 and PS3

softmod-Install of software into the console controller
hardmod-Applying hardware

Investigators can team up on game sessions, to chat up suspects, document chats, and gain digital evidence

A Linux distro machine can work inside an Xbox
An Xbox can be modified for usage as a web server, personal computer

Very little information or references on how to extract information from an Xbox

In-game communication is not stored anywhere. Everything from billing purchases, IP Address of the box is stored by Microsoft
