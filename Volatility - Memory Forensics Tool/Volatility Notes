Memory Forensics, using Volatality

My recommendation - Do the Volatality room on TryHackMe to supplement your learning

Volatility is a tool to help analyze memory images,during incident response.

Memory is catured, using images.Images have .raw extension
Images are captured using tools,such as Redline and FTK Imager

Offline machine (Linux or Windows) memory image files can be obtained easily, since they are not encrypted.
For Windows- %SystemDrive%/hiberfil.sys  
This is the hibernation file, which takes the memory image and is then used at the next boot up, for faster booting

Virtual Machines also have image files

VMWARE- .vmem -These image files can be uses, when the machine is on, hence preserving the machone's frensic integrity

Each Windows OS has a different memory image and we have PROFILES in Volatality, to analyze memory images

Our first command-volatility -f <memoryimage.extension> imageinfo -To check which volatility profile is suitable

To view acive processess  
Command  - volatility -f <memeoryfile.extension> imageinfo--profile=PROFILE pslist

To view active connections 
Command - volatility -f cridex.exe --profile=PROFILE netscan

To view active processes(possibly malware) that is hidden

Command - volatility -f cridex.vmem psxview (If false, it is a malware)
 
To view if a file has been affected in a greater detail 

Command- volatiility -f <memoryfile.extension> ldrmodules (If false,file has been laced by SQL Injection)

This command provides 3 columns INInit,InLoad,InMem - If all 3 columns return false, it is a sign of possible injection

Malfind command-To find if file has been infected with malware.Also we will dump the malware laced files to a directory

Command-volatility -f cridex.vmem--profile=PROFILE malfind -D <directory path> recommended to use /tmp

Pulling out the infected files, using the pid of the process 

Command- volatility -f cridex.vmem--profile=PROFILE --pid <PID> dildump -D <directory path> recommended to use /tmp
