DFIR Module 2

Seperating data from noisy ones-Searching by keyword

Types of Forensic Investigations:-

Public-Taxpayer's money is used to pay for court proceedings.Longer the court ruling,higher will be the cost

Private (for businesses)-Deals with money extortion.laundering,fraud employess etc.
Deals with loss of employment,money,goods etc

Availablity of credible evidence helps the case to be more confident.

Types of evidence in Private Investigations:-

Exculpatory Evidence-Evidence that may appear to be favourable to the suspect.May be used to acquit the suspect.

Inculpatory Evidence-Evidence to pin suspect to case.Suspect may have broken employee agreements,usage of company resources to perform crime etc

Evidence can range from:-

Physical-Storage devices
Digital-Bits and bytes from the device

For a search,warrants ARE important.

Warrants are required for searching through the digital evidence.

A warrant for a search on device used in narcotics dealings and storing narcotic transaction dealings cannot be extended to charge a suspect for storing child porn,if found on the computer.

An additional warrant should be gained,asking for permission to search and charge suspect for storing child porn


Building the Plan for a investigation:-

Lead investigator assigns tasks to each individual(Also known as Seperation of Tasks),keeping skill sets in mind.The result is then forwarded to the investigator.

The lead forensics investigator requires high level of certification,when presenting cases before the legal system.He/she only contributes to assignment of tasks(seperation of duties) to the team 

Seperation of Tasks:-
Physical Collection
Data Collection
Evidence Analysis


Use of a Journal:

a)For the lead investigator-Explain and go into detail about events,individuals assigned tasks,skillset of each person.He/she is the main contributor to the journal

b)Forensic Investigator-The person,who analyzes the digital evidence

Tools used in the investigation:-
Hardware-Workstations,Faraday cages,Electrostatic bags
Software-Maquisition,Winhex,Ulltimate Sluthing kit etc

TIP FOR SAFETY:_
Disconnect a computer,before extracting internal hard drives.It can give a shock.

At the crime scene:-

a)Survey the crime scene
Create a sketch
Take photographs
Divide the scene into groups,where evidence was found
Mark spots with 'X'

b)Identify the evidence-It can be either physical classification or digital

c)Ask questions about the evidence collected

Transporting evidence:-
Should be sealed
Placed in protection bags.
Care taken to not destroy it

Chain of Custody-Things to remember
Logs of evidence taken out and kept back in
Evidence forms
What was done to it?

Acquiring evidence:-

Scan the entire disk  or
Scan a partition of the disk 

Disk Image Acquisation:-

Use writeblocker
Disconnect the storage device from which the image is being acquired

Example of Acquisation in Linux:-
1)Run 'fdisk'-Gives information about the disk partitions

Partition 1- x - x cylinders
Partition 2- x+1 -  x-n cylinders

2)Take a copy of fstab (Centos) or vsftab(Unix)-Gives more information about the partitions

3)Use disk dumper (dd) to transfer content of partition,file to a destination partition or file-Image-Disk Dumper Command

Validation of Evidence-Using SHA256 or MD5 Hashes

Hash the original copy,verify with the copied data.
CHECKSUM OF HASH should be calculated,should be the same and noted in the journal

Sterilization of Media

Whenever investigators want to store the collected data,onto some storage media,it should be sterilized

The storage media can be used in cases to store data and should be sterilzied after every use
Forensics wiping is different from disk formatting and is done using tools such as FTK,Encase etc

Indexing Files to get juicy information-Faster search,less noisy data will be come across.Tools used-OSForensics and dtSearch

Discriminating data-Remove noisy data from information

In Windows:-

Windows Registry-Database where all actions performed by a user are stored.Stores configuration settings,passwords etc.

All processes and systems running on a Windows machine stores information there.
Gain snapshots of a system,at a particular point of time

Very useful to a investigator
Skilled attacker can hide information and files in it

Windows Event Logs-Stores information about failed logins,tampering with security configuration etc.
Date Time User Event ID

System Restore-Should be done before investigator investigates the system

Gains snapshot of system ,in time

Shortcuts/Links-Match relationships between messages sent between authors and recievers,suspects,events,time etc.This information is gained using Visualization

MS Office Metadata-Data can be gained by FTK,Encase etc
Image File metadata
Browser Artifiacts=FTK tool is used
Mail artifacts-Tools used-Paraben's Email Examiner or Xaminer
Chat Artifacts-Tool Used-Paraben's Chat Examiner-
Places to check for Chat Artifacts-RAM,Browser cache,mobile system dumps

Recycle Bin
Printer Cache-Data sent by the computer to printer is in either raw ormetafile formats.The shadow files are stored in c:\windows\system31\spool\printers
Tools used-EMF Spoo,Encase

Partition Recovery-If a suspect has deleted a partition,then it is still available to the investigator to uncover.Same is the case,if the partition is overwritten,damaged or not recognzied by the OS.
Tools Used-Active Partition Recovery

Dumping of RAM Contents or running processes-Encase or ProDiscover IR

Active Network Connections from Open Sockets,in a memory dump=To view Connection history,

Tool used to recover information should have-Active TCP Connections,IP Routing Table,View active UDP Connections

Recover User Name and Password hashes from dump-Tools used=ElcomSoft

Discrimination of Data:-

a)Remove files having well known signatures-Billions of copies of the same file exist in other computers

It requires steps:-
Signatures of files from acquired image
Signatures of files from other source
A tool to compare both set of signatures

Steps:-
Install Media
Clean Install
Package Repositories
Change Aware Systems

b)Find for a specific file type

Command- find /acquired image -type f -exec file{}; |grep file

c)File System Structure


Extraction of data includes:-
Compression
Decryption
Carving

A step to be performed while analyzing evidence:-
Suitable lab environment with required tools
Secure the system
Make a copy of the data and validate it

A disk image will be enough to fully reconstruct a disk
